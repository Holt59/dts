# `dts` - `reverse(std)`

This repository contains implementation of some classes of the C++ standard library. These implementations have been written for the sake of the exercice, and to improve my C++ skills, and should **certainly not be used in any decent C++ application** since these implementations:

- have not been (extensively) tested;
- have not been written to be efficient.

These implementations are in C++14 and should be standard conforming, unless unavailable features from future standards are required (e.g. `inline` variables).
